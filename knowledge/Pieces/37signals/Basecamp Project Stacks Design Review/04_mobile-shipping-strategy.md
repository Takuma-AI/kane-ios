# Mobile Shipping Strategy

## The Mobile Sync Challenge

### The Problem Statement
"So like, mobile is working on supporting this. And it's just going to be, you know, read only on mobile. So you're going to create stacks and stuff like that. We're not doing that right now. But like, you know, you'd be able to see your stacks, obviously, on mobile."

Timeline: "So that's probably going to be, you know, two wish weeks, maybe a little bit more. And before it's ready on mobile."

### The Core Question
"Are we okay shipping this. You make a bunch of stacks. You go to mobile and the stacks aren't there. And you know, all the projects are there because, well, they're all, they're all pin print. Anyway, all the projects are there. Yeah. But they're not in stacks."

## Jason's Analysis

### The Risk Scenario
"If you put a dozen projects, you start to really organize things. You put a dozen here and a dozen there. Before you had three pin things because like those are your top three things. And you always want them at the top. And now all of a sudden, you're going to have, you know, 27 things at the top."

### The Cascade Effect
"And now, now your pins are less valuable. Then, then before. And then I imagine if you start to unpin projects because you're like, wait a second. I just want these three pin. Then it's going to start to mess with your stacks on desktop. But you won't be able to see that until you get back to desktop. And now your folder or your stack has eight things instead of 12."

### Mobile Screen Reality
"Normally we, we just ship stuff. And mobile would catch up or mobile would be ahead of us or whatever. But given the fact that this is the home screen and mobile screens are small to begin with. I think people. That might find, you know, a few dozen surprise projects up there and pin to be quite frustrating."

## The Team's Perspective

### Branch Management Concerns
"Certainly going on sort of our, you know, normal approach of like, well, don't we don't want to be waiting on stuff. So, you know, just like didn't want this branch to sit out there for too long. And now we got to rebase it."

### Risk Assessment
"So people would have, you know, how many people were going to be involved. Like people would have to know about the feature. They'd have to try the feature. They'd have to probably create a bunch of stacks or a lot of projects in the stacks. And then they'd have to be using mobile and use it a lot. So by general thought was like, you know, the risk was fairly low."

## The Mobile Advantage Argument

Jason recognizes the potential: "You could almost take advantage of these stacks because it's going to make your life on mobile a lot easier. And like, you know, like, oh my gosh, if I could put all my cycle projects in my stack and on my phone, it'd be so much easier to manage and then you do it and like it doesn't work."

"I think that the fact that it stacks are actually very beneficial on a small screen on mobile is another plus and in waiting."

## The Soft Launch Solution

### Jason's Proposal
"Here's another way to do it. We could just ship it as is don't tell anybody it exists. Yeah. Or people are going to find an idea, you know, just like just put it out there. We can start using it anyway. Some people will find it somehow by accident. And then we don't have to keep branches synced up like this."

### Community Involvement Strategy
"We could tell the community and just say, hey, look, here's how it works. Just so you know, for the next few weeks, it's not going to be available on mobile. Therefore, if you do this, this is going to happen. So you might want to hold off on that."

### The Benefits
"That'd be a nice thing to actually to involve them. Now they think about it. Just letting them know up front. We wouldn't announce it publicly in that way. Where hey, just by so you know, like this is going to be kind of weird on mobile. This is like more of an insider thing."

## The Personal Organization Factor

Doran's insight: "You had a very good point about this experience. You know, creating stacks and organizing your stuff is such a personal thing to do. Right. Like I can definitely see myself organizing all my stacks and then going on mobile. I'm not seeing them. I'll be like, where's my stuff?"

## Final Decision

The team settles on a soft launch: "Yeah, soft lunch. Yeah. Yeah."

Jason's conclusion: "As long as we again, tell the community that this is sort of hey, you guys have an early preview essentially. This is live in your account, but it's a bit of a, you know, early preview. We're not going to announce this formally for everybody until. Uh, this is working on mobile, but here's what will happen if you do it. So, you know, proceed at your own risk, essentially."

The pragmatic benefit: "That'd be, that'd be good. I would solve all of our problems too, but branches won't know."
