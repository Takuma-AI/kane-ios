# Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again) - Index

**Source:** Y Combinator  
**Type:** Conference Talk  
**Theme:** Evolution of software paradigms with AI/LLMs  
**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Speaker:** Andrej Karpathy (Former Director of AI at Tesla)

## Talk Overview

Andrej Karpathy explores how software is undergoing fundamental changes with the advent of AI and LLMs, introducing three paradigms: Software 1.0 (traditional code), Software 2.0 (neural network weights), and Software 3.0 (prompts in natural language). He discusses the implications for developers entering the industry and provides practical guidance for building with these new tools.

### üéØ **Software Paradigms & Evolution**
- [Chapter 1: The Three Software Paradigms](01_three-software-paradigms.md) - Software 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 explained
- [Chapter 2: LLMs as Operating Systems](02_llms-as-operating-systems.md) - Understanding the new computational platform

### üõ†Ô∏è **Building with LLMs**
- [Chapter 3: LLM Psychology and Limitations](03_llm-psychology-limitations.md) - Working with fallible AI systems
- [Chapter 4: Partial Autonomy Applications](04_partial-autonomy-applications.md) - Building effective LLM apps
- [Chapter 5: AI-Assisted Development](05_ai-assisted-development.md) - Practical workflows and techniques

### üåç **Future Implications**
- [Chapter 6: Vibe Coding and Natural Programming](06_vibe-coding-natural-programming.md) - Everyone becomes a programmer
- [Chapter 7: Building for Agents](07_building-for-agents.md) - Adapting infrastructure for AI consumers

## Key Themes Across Chapters
- **Paradigm Shift**: Software development is changing more fundamentally than it has in 70 years
- **Democratization**: Natural language programming makes everyone a potential developer
- **Human-AI Cooperation**: The importance of keeping AI "on the leash" while maximizing productivity
- **Infrastructure Evolution**: Need to adapt digital infrastructure for AI consumers
- **Practical Application**: Focus on partial autonomy over full automation

## Query Examples
- "How does Karpathy define the three software paradigms?"
- "What are the key principles for building effective LLM applications?"
- "How should developers think about the autonomy slider in their products?"
- "What infrastructure changes are needed to support AI agents?"
- "What are the cognitive limitations of LLMs that developers need to work around?"
