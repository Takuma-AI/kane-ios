## The Core Philosophy

"If you ask me, what's the most important tech trend in AI? I would say is the rise of agent to AI."

Andrew Ng identifies agentic AI as the most significant technological development, fundamentally changing how we approach AI problem-solving from single-pass outputs to iterative, research-based workflows.

## The Linear Writing Problem

### Traditional LLM Usage
"The way a lot of us use LOMs is to prompt it to have it during an output. And the way we have an LOM output something is as if you're going to a human, or in this case, an AI, and asking it to please type on an essay for you by writing from the first word to the last word, all in one go, whatever, using backspace."

### The Human Parallel
"And humans, we don't do our best writing, being forced to type in this linear order. And it turns out neither does AI, but despite the difficulty of being forced to write in this linear way, our LOMs do surprisingly well."

## The Agentic Alternative

### Iterative Workflow Design
"With agentic workflows, we can go to AI system and ask it to please first write an essay online, then do some web research if it needs to, and fetch some web pages to put in their own context, then write the first draft, then read the first draft in critique, and revise it, and so on."

### The Power of Iteration
"And so we end up with this iterative workflow where your model does some thinking and some research, does some revision, goes back to do more thinking, and by going around this loop many times, it is slower, but it delivers a much better work product."

## Real-World Applications

### AI Fund's Use Cases
"For a lot of projects, AI fund has worked on everything from pulling out complex compliance documents to medical diagnosis, to reasoning about complex legal documents. We found that these agentic workflows are really a huge difference within it working, versus not working."

**Key Domains**:
- Complex compliance documents
- Medical diagnosis
- Legal document analysis
- Any task requiring deep reasoning

### The Make-or-Break Factor
"We found that these agentic workflows are really a huge difference within it working, versus not working."

## The Business Opportunity

### Workflow Transformation
"But a lot of the work that needs to be done, a lot of available businesses to be built still, will be taking workflows, existing or new workflows, and figuring out how to implement them into these types of agentic workflows."

### Implementation Challenge
**The Opportunity**: Converting traditional workflows to agentic ones  
**The Challenge**: Requires understanding both the domain and agentic design patterns

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### The New Orchestration Layer
"What has emerged over the last year is a new agentic orchestration layer that helps application builders orchestrate or coordinate a lot of calls to the technology layers underneath."

**Benefits**:
- Simplifies application development
- Handles complex multi-step workflows
- Coordinates multiple AI calls
- Manages context across iterations

### Impact on Development
"And the good news is the orchestration layer has made it even easier to build applications."

## Mental Model: Research-Based Intelligence

### Traditional Approach
```
Prompt → Single AI Call → Output
```

### Agentic Approach
```
Prompt → Research → Draft → Critique → Revise → Research → Refine → Output
```

### The Trade-off
**Speed**: Agentic workflows are slower  
**Quality**: "It delivers a much better work product"

## Design Principles for Agentic Workflows

### 1. Multi-Step Thinking
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Allow for research and fact-gathering
- Enable self-reflection and critique

### 2. Iterative Refinement
- Initial draft → Review → Revision cycles
- Continuous improvement through multiple passes
- Context building across iterations

### 3. External Resource Integration
- Web research capabilities
- Document retrieval and analysis
- Real-time information gathering

## The Marketing Confusion

### Term Dilution
"About a year and a half ago, when I started to go around and give talks to try to convince people that AI agents might be a thing, I did not realize that around last summer, a bunch of marketers would get a hold of this term and use it as a sticker and slap it on everything in sight, which made it almost lose some of its meaning."

### Technical Definition
True agentic AI involves:
- Multi-step reasoning processes
- Self-directed research and fact-gathering
- Iterative refinement cycles
- Complex workflow orchestration

## Practical Implementation

### When to Use Agentic Workflows
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Research-heavy problems
- Multi-step processes
- Quality-critical outputs

### When Traditional Approaches Suffice
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- Speed-critical applications
- Low-stakes outputs
- Straightforward transformations

## Key Takeaway

"I'll share with you from a technical perspective, why I think agentic AI is exciting and important, and also opens up a lot more startup opportunities."

Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift from treating AI as a single-use tool to leveraging it as an iterative, research-capable intelligence system. This creates new opportunities for startups to build workflows that were previously impossible.
