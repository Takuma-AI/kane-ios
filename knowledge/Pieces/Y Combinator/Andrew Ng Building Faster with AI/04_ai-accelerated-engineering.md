## The Core Philosophy

"It turns out that with AI coding assistance, which Andre talked about as well, rapid engineering is becoming possible in a way that just was not possible. It's becoming much more feasible. So the speed of engineering is going up rapidly and the cost of engineering is also going down rapidly."

Andrew Ng identifies AI-assisted coding as a transformative force that fundamentally changes startup development dynamics and feedback loops.

## The Two Types of Software Development

### Type 1: Quick and Dirty Prototypes
"Sometimes I've built quick and dirty prototypes to test an idea, and say, we'll build a new customer service chat ball. Let's build an AI to process legal documents or whatever. But the quick and dirty prototype to see if we think it works."

### Type 2: Production Software
"The other type of software I do is, write, maintain production software, maintain legacy software, but these massive production-ready code bases."

## The Speed Differential

### Production Code: Modest Gains
"You know, when writing production quality code, maybe we're 30% to 50% faster with AI assistance, hard to find a rigorous number."

### Prototyping: Exponential Gains
"But in terms of building quick and dirty prototypes, we're not 50% faster. I think we're easily 10 times faster, maybe much more than 10 times faster."

## Why Prototyping Accelerates Dramatically

### Reduced Integration Complexity
"When you're building standalone prototypes, this less integration with legacy software infrastructure and legacy data needed."

### Relaxed Requirements
"Also, the requirements for reliability, even scalability, even security are much lower."

### The Security Permission
"And I know I'm not supposed to tell people to write insecure code, right? Feels like the wrong thing to say. But I routinely go to my team and say, go ahead, write insecure code. Because if this software is only gonna run on your laptop, and if you don't plan to maliciously hack your own laptop, it's fine to have insecure code, right?"

**Important Caveat**: "But of course, after it seems to be working, please do make a secure before you ship it to someone else."

## The New Development Strategy

### Systematic Innovation Through Prototyping
"And so I find increasingly, starters will systematically pursue innovations by building 20 prototypes to see what works, right?"

### The Proof of Concept Economics
"Because I know that there's some ads in AI, a lot of proof of concepts don't make into production. But I think by driving the cost of a proof of concept low enough, it's actually fine. I've lost a proof of concepts. Don't see the light of day."

## The "Move Fast" Philosophy

### Learning from Past Mistakes
"And I know that the mantra, move fast and break things got a bad rep, because it broke things. And some teams took away from this that you should not move fast, but I think that's a mistake."

### The Responsible Alternative
"I tend to tell my teams to move fast and be responsible. And I think they actually lost their ways to move really quickly while still being responsible."

## The Evolution of AI Coding Tools

### First Generation: Code Autocomplete
"I think was it three, four years ago, code autocomplete, right? Popularized by GitHub, co-pilot."

### Second Generation: AI-Enabled IDEs
"And then there was a cursor, wind-served generation of AI-enabled IDEs. We're in great use, wind-served cursor, quite a lot."

### Third Generation: Agentic Coding
"And then starting on our six, seven months ago, decided to be this new generation of high-dagentic coding assistance, including, like you're using, oh, fee a lot for coding. Cloud code is fantastic."

### Tool Evolution Speed
"Since Cloud 4 release has become, and I've been getting a few months, I may use something different, but the tools are evolving really rapidly."

## The Generation Gap Effect

### Competitive Advantage
"And the interesting thing is, if you're even half a generation or one generation behind, it actually makes a big difference compared to if you're on top of the latest tools."

### Changed Approaches
"And I find my team is taking really different approaches to software engineering now compared to even fee or six months ago."

## The Devaluation of Code

### Traditional View
"One surprising thing is, we're used to thinking of code as this really valuable artifact, because it's so hard to create."

### New Reality
"But because the cost of software engineering is going down, code is much less of a valuable artifact as it used to."

### Practical Examples
"Some on teams where, we've completely rebuilt the code base three times the last month, right? Because it's not that hard anymore to just completely rebuild the code base. Pick a new data schema is fine, because the cost of doing that has plummeted."

## The Two-Way Door Transformation

### Bezos's Framework
"Some of you may have heard of Jeff Bezos' terminology of a two-aidor versus a one-way door. A two-aidor's decision they can make. If you change your mind, come back out, you know, reverse it relatively cheap. Whereas the one-way door is, you make a decision and you change your mind is very costly, very difficult to reverse."

### Traditional One-Way Doors
"So choosing the software architecture of your text stack, used to be a one-way door. Once you build on top of a certain text stack, you know, set the database schema really hard to change it."

### New Flexibility
"I don't want to say it's totally a two-way door, but I find that my team will more often build on a certain text stack a week later, change your mind. Let's throw the code base away and redo it from scratch on the new text stack."

**Realistic Assessment**: "I don't want to over-hype it. We don't do that all the time. There are still costs to redoing that."

## The Democratization Effect

### Contrary Career Advice
"Over the last year, a bunch of people have advised others not to learn to code on the browser AI will automate it. I think we'll look back on this as some of the worst career advice ever given."

### The Historical Pattern
"Because as better tools make software engineering easier, more people should do it, not fewer. So when many decades ago, the world moved from punch cards to keyboard and terminal that made coding easier. When we moved from assemblies, high-level languages like Cobalt, there are actually people arguing back then that now we have Cobalt, we don't need programmers anymore."

### The Controversial Opinion
"I have a controversial opinion, which is, I think it's actually time for everyone of every job role to learn to code."

## Universal Coding at AI Fund

### Cross-Functional Coding
"And in fact, on my team, my CFO, my head of talent, my recruiters, my friend desk person, all of them knew how to code and I should see all of them performing better at all of their job functions because they can code."

### The Art History Example
"And one of my team members knew art history. And so he could prompt mid-Journey with the genre, the palette, the artistic inspiration had a very good control over the images he generated. So we end up using all of Tommy's generous images."

**Contrast**: "Whereas in Contrast, I don't know art history. And so when I prompt your image generation, I could write, please make pretty pictures of robots for me, right? And I could never have the control that my collaborates are good."

## The Core Skill of the Future

### Command and Control
"And I think with computers, one of the most important skills of the future is the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want so that it will do it for you."

### Deeper Understanding
"And there will be people that have that deeper understanding of computers that will be able to command the computer to get the outcome you want."

### AI-Assisted Development
"And learning to code, not that you need to write the code yourself, steer AI to code for you. It seems like it will remain the best way to do that for a long time."

## Key Takeaway

"This changes the mechanisms by which we drive startups around this loop."

AI-accelerated engineering transforms startup development by:
- **Enabling rapid prototyping** (10x faster)
- **Reducing code attachment** (easier to rebuild)
- **Democratizing development** (everyone can code)
- **Changing decision reversibility** (more two-way doors)
- **Shifting bottlenecks** (from engineering to product feedback)

The future belongs to those who can effectively command AI to build what they envision.
